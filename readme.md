This is a link to my map with points of interest relevant to me.

I made a map that shows points of interest related to my life. I changed the point color and outline; I changed the SceneView to "local" to make the map appear flat instead of as a globe and changed the camera position so it would show my Malaysia point upon loading in addition to my U.S. points; and I changed the popup to be docked in the lower left corner and include the country, since I have a point in Malaysia.
